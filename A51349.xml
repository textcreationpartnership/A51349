            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THoſe impudent Letters inverted by ſome of the Jeſuitical Crew, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Nat.

            <p>SIR <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death being the ſad Occaſion of this Narrative, and the Subject of moſt Peoples Diſcourſe; I ſhall (to prevent any falſe or ſurreptitious Stories that are uſually carried abroad about things of this Nature) give the Reader this true and impartial Account thereof.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62855:2"/>
            <p> On the 12th. of this inſtant <hi>October,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> about Nine of the Clock in the Morning, Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> went out of his own Houſe in <hi>Greens Lane</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> about his Occaſions; and was ſeen not long after near <hi>Marybone,</hi> but then ſuppoſed to be going home, and was at one of the Church Wardens of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> about ſome buſineſs at twelve of the Clock the ſame day: But ſo it was that he came not to his Houſe that Night, according to his uſual cuſtom, nor gave any notice to his Servants of any buſineſs that he had to hinder his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that night. And from that time, till <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th of the ſame Month, about Six a Clock at Night, no tideings could be heard of him (although all earneſt and diligent Enquiries and Searches were made for him.) At which time his Body was found dead in a Ditch, upon the South ſide of <hi>Primroſe Hill Hampſtead.</hi> The occaſion of his being found was this; One <hi>Bromly</hi> a Baker, and <hi>Waters</hi> a Farrier, both of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s <hi>in the Fields,</hi> having an occaſion to go to the Houſe, commonly called the <hi>White-Houſe</hi> near <hi>Primroſe Hill;</hi> and going over the Field where the Body of Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> lay, ſaw, as they thought, a Sword and Belt, and a Stick and a pair of Gloves lying together hard by the Hedge Side: but they went not near to meddle with them, ſuppoſing her had belonged to ſome perſon that was gone into the Ditch to eaſe himſelf. And when they came to the <hi>White-houſe,</hi> they told <hi>John Rawſon</hi> (the man of the ſaid Houſe) that they had ſeen a Sword and Belt, and a pair of Gloves and Stick lie in that place: Whereupon <hi>John Rawſon</hi> asked them, why they did not bring them thither? They told him, they did not know but there might be ſomebody hard by to own them. <hi>Rawſon</hi> told them that there had been ſeveral Souldiers thereabout this Week a Hedghog hunting, and and it may be (ſaid he) ſome of them may have left them behind them.</p>
            <p>After ſome farther Diſcourſe, <hi>Rawſon</hi> agreed to go with the two men to the place, and if they found the things there, then <hi>Rawſon</hi> was to give them a Shilling to drink, and was to take the things to his own Houſe, till ſome body came thither to own them; and thereupon they went together to the place: When they came there they found only a Belt, and a Scabbard, and a pair of Gloves, but no Sword: which as <hi>Rawſon</hi> was ſtooping to take up, he thought he ſaw ſomething like a man in the Ditch hard by; and ſo going to the Ditch, there they ſaw a Man lying as they ſuppos'd upon his Belly, with a Sword run through him, and the point appearing about ſeven or eight Inches above his Back. Upon this they went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Church-warden of the Pariſh, to give him an account of it; but he being ſick, ſent them to Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s the Conſtable, who preſently taking with him ſeveral Neighbours and Houſe-keepers, went to the place where the Body lay; which was in a dry Ditch upon the South ſide of <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> about two Fields diſtant from the <hi>White-houſe:</hi> The Poſture in which he lay was this, he had a Sword run into him, juſt under his left Pap, which came out upon the right ſide of his Back, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven Inches, one of his hands being doubled under, on which he ſeemed to lean, the other hand lying upon the Bank; his Hair Camlet Coat being turn'd up over his head, his Hat and Periwig being among the Buſhes over his head; but no Band nor Cravta could be found about him, although when he went from home, he he had a large Lac'd Band on.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable and the reſt that were with him, being about a dozen, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the manner of his lying, cauſed him to be removed, and the Sword drawn out of his Body: concerning which Sword it is obſervable, that the point of it which came out at his Back was covered all over with Blood, and that part which was in his body was black, without any Blood upon it.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable having caus'd the Body to be removed to the <hi>White Houſe,</hi> and knowing it to be the Body of Sir <hi>Edmondberry Godfrey,</hi> he cauſed his Pockets to be ſearched, and found in one of them in one Paper Six Guineys, and in another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per four broad Pieces of Gold, and a half Crown; and in the other Pockets two Rings, whereof one was a Diamond, one Guiney, and four pound in Silver, and two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62855:2"/>ſmall Pieces of Gold, and one Ring he had upon one of his fingers: His Pocket book (in which he uſed to take noets of Examination) being only miſſing.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th. of this inſtant, Mr. <hi>Coopet</hi> the Coroner of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd a Jury at the <hi>White-Horſe</hi> to inquire about the occaſion of the Death of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edmondberry Godfrey:</hi> and two Chorurgions (having been firſt Sworn) viewed the Body in the preſence of the Coroner and the Jary and found two wounds about it, which one of the Chyrurgions ſearched with his Probe, and found one of them not above an inch deep, the Probe going againſt one of his <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; but the other being a little below the left Pap, went quite thorow the Body: His face was of a fleſh colour, though in his lifetime very pale, ſome what ſwell'd, and a green circle about his Neck, as if he had been ſtrengled, his blood being ſe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d about his Neck, Throat, and the upper part of his Breaſt. The Chyrurgions having viewed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, delivered their Judgments, That the Wounds they found about him, were not the cauſe of his Death, but that he was ſuffocated before the Wound were made. And that which may fully perſwade any perſon of the truth <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is, That there was not one drop of blood to be found in the place where he lay, not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing: though the Ditch was dry, and it might have been eaſily ſeen if there had been any. Another thing was, That the very bottoms of the ſoles of his Shooes were as clean as if he had but juſt come out of his own C<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> which was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign that he was carried thither.</p>
            <p>A third thing very remarkable; is, That one of the Jury aſſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, That a Servant of his Mothers (who is owner of the ground where the Body lay) with a Butcher and two Boys, made a very ſtrict and narrow ſearch in all parts of that ground for a Calf that was miſſing, upon <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, and a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> there lay no dead Body, Belt, Gloves, Stick, or other things there.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe ſeveral falſe Reports have gone abroad, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ding to the Diſhonour of this Worthy Deceaſed Knight, as though he had been diſcontented about ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys owing by him to the Pariſh, and upon that account ſhould make himſelf <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Relator thinks good to teſtifie to the VVorld, That to his own knowledge Sir <hi>Edmondberry</hi> lent the Pariſh above 300 <hi>l.</hi> without Intereſt, a good part of which is yet unpaid; ſo palpable an untruth it is, that ſome wicked perſons have ſpread abroad about him. But it is no wonder that thoſe inhumane VVretches that have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life, ſhould go alſo about to bleſt his Reputation.</p>
            <p>One thing more I cannot omit to mention, having received it from the mouth of one of the late Church VVardens of the Pariſh where he liv'd, which is, That Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondberry</hi> not long ago gave him an Hundred Pounds to beſtow upon ſuch poor People in the Pariſh as he knew were in want: Neither was that the firſt time that Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi> had imployed him in works of that nature, having often made him the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buter of his Charity, becauſe he did not deſire the Applauſe of Men for it. This without all doubt proceeded from ſo remarkable and ſo ſincere a piety, That though it may be commended, I am afraid it will ſcarce be imitated.</p>
            <p>Now we ſhall only make theſe Remarks on the ſame, that in his Preamble <hi>Nat. Tomſon</hi> tells you, That he had here Printed the true Relation, to prevent falſe and ſurreptitious Stories that are uſually carried abroad about things of this nature. If you believe him now, and what he impudently avers, he then was an egregious Liar before, when he Printed and Publiſhed this Narrative.</p>
            <p>But beſides that Sir <hi>Edmondberry Godfreys</hi> Death was then the ſad occaſion of his Narrative, and is now become his Ridicule. The whole Relation under his hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds and contradicts his Letters to <hi>Prance,</hi> which he has impudently promiſed to juſtifie; <hi>[auri ſacra fames!]</hi> what will not wretches do for <hi>Guineys?</hi> But obſerve farther, in his Impartial and True Narrative, as he calls it himſelf, he tells you, that his Face was freſh coloured, and ſomewhat ſwell'd, and a green Circle about his Neck, as if he had been ſtrangled, and the blood ſettled about his Neck and Throat, and the upper part of his Breaſt; and that it was the Judgment of the Chyrurgions that he wa
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62855:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuffocated, and that the VVounds were not the cauſe of his Death. All which was Truth; and as he then himſelf ſaid, that as an Evidence of that Truth, there was not one drop of blood found in the Ditch, though the Ditch were dry, <hi>page</hi> 7. and might eaſily have been ſeen if there had been any: yet this very ſame Perſon now gives himſelf the Lie, and tells you of lots of blood found about him and in the Ditch, as you may ſee in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> Sure he had forgot what he had before Publiſhed concerning this thing, or he thought every body elſe had.</p>
            <p>In the next place concerning his Shooes which he ſays in the Letter to <hi>France</hi> were full of Graſs Seeds, which proved he had gone thither himſelf, the vanity and al Contrivance of which has already been obſerved, and that it could not be at that time of the Year; but Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> tells you <hi>Page</hi> 7. ſure you will believe himſelf, That it was an evident ſign that he was carried thither, becauſe the bottom of his Soles were as clean as if he had but juſt come out of his own Chamber.</p>
            <p>Then that he ſhould have lain here from the time he was miſſing, as this <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> would prove, in ſaying, the corners of his Eyes and Mouth were fly-blown, which was a palpable Lye and ill contriv'd, conſidering the time of the Year; he contradicts that himſelf in this Narrative, and tells you <hi>Page</hi> 7. That the Ground was narrowly ſearched on <hi>Tueſday</hi> for a Calf, and that then to dead body lay in the Ditch, nor any Belt, Gloves, Stick, or the like to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I obſerve how zealous he then was to vindicate this Knights Honour, and Reputation, which he would now take away, for he ſays, that ſome falſe Reports have gone abroad tending to the diſhonour of the Deceaſed Knight, as if being diſcont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, he ſhould have made himſelf away, and <hi>Page</hi> 8. ſo palpable an untruth it is that theſe wicked wretches have ſpread abroad about him; but 'tis no wonder that thoſe inhumane wretches that have taken away his Life (mark that) ſhould go alſo about to blaſt his Reputation. Yet ſuch a VVretch is this <hi>Thompſon</hi> now become, to contradict himſelf, and give himſelf the Lie under his own hand, and impudently go about to juſtifie it.</p>
